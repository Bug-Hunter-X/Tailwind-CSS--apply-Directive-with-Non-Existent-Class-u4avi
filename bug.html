This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that doesn't exist or is misspelled.  For example:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 @apply text-red-500 text-wrong-class"></div>
```

If `text-wrong-class` is not defined in your Tailwind configuration, it won't throw an error during build, but the class won't be applied, resulting in unexpected styling.
